# SplitKeebsCommunicator
This is a work in progress Software and Build Guide with a split board without a cable connecting the two halves together instead connecting them directly to the computer and using a software to handle the communication instead of the cable.

# Software
The software is really WIP atm, i am still learning how to communicate with HID devices but i am working on it while i am waiting the parts of the keyboard to arrive.

I dont plan to support more platforms besides Windows at the moment as C# does not have a good UI framework for multi platform, and this will heavily use Win32 features to work.

# BuildGuide
WARNING: This build guide will be handwired and this kind of builds takes lots effort and time, use a PCB if you dont want to put the effort or dont want to waste time.
The build guide will be a simple guide with a few tip and tricks, what materials i used and how i built mine so you can use it as a reference on your build.
