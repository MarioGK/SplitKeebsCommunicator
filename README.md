# SplitKeebsCommunicator
This is a work in progress Software and Build Guide with a split board without a cable connecting the two halves together instead we will be connecting them directly to the computer with different USB cables and using a software to handle the communication between them instead of the cable.

Why not use QMK?

Well there a bunch of reasons to use or not to use QMK, i will try to summerize them and explain why i decided to make my own firmware instead of using the well known QMK.

#### Reasons to use:
1. A bunch of features.
2. A bunch of keyboards already supported either officially or by the community.
3. They are using the awesome ChibiOS RTOS which has a bunch of features

#### Reasons not to use:
1. Having a bunch of features means that you have a bunch of bloat as well.
2. Hard to learn all of its concepts and do complex stuff with.
3. Doing it yourself you learn how everything works along the way.


# BuildGuide
WARNING: This build guide will be handwired and this kind of builds takes lots effort and time, use a PCB if you dont want to put the effort or dont want to waste time.


The build guide will be a simple guide with a few tip and tricks, what materials i used and how i built mine so you can use it as a reference on your build.
